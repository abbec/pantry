# pantry
Pantry is a small service for leasing hardware from a pool

## Setting up
To get a development environment up and running, install all requirements with:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all requirements and pantry itself as an editable package. This is needed for unit tests to be able to find it.
